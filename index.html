    Audrey is one of my favorite people. She stands out in the classroom.
    She is one of the few people I have met who can effectively plan their work and work the plan.
    She has great character, being exceptionally polite, positive, and straight-forward.
    For these reasons and more, I believe everyone who knows Audrey is rooting for her.
    She would be successful in, and supportive of, the graduate program community.

    She stands out in the classroom. As the sole instructor for a sophomore and junior level computer
    algorithms course, CS320, I saw Audrey and a few other hard working students lead their over 120 peers
    in comprehension, enthusiasm, and grades.

    She is one of the few people I have met who can effectively plan their work and work the plan.
    Getting to know her during the semester I found her to be highly organized about her academic work
    and her time working on academics. She consistently had work finished early for class,
    even as she balanced school and a job.

    She has great character, being exceptionally polite, positive, and straight-forward.
    Audrey is always a pleasure to speak with, as she becomes informed before meeting and
    knows what she wants to know.
